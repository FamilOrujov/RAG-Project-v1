## Professional Summary
Kaelen is the chief architect and technical lead for Innovatech's **CoreLLM**, our foundational AI technology. He is a distinguished expert in machine learning infrastructure and large-scale model training. Kaelen's work is pivotal to maintaining our competitive edge in the AI space, focusing on enhancing model capabilities, optimizing performance, and ensuring the scalability of our AI services. He is the company's ultimate authority on transformer models and distributed computing.

## Key Responsibilities
- **AI Architecture:** Design and maintain the end-to-end architecture of the CoreLLM training and inference pipelines, including data preprocessing, distributed training frameworks (FSDP), and model serving infrastructure on our **Stratus Infrastructure** cloud environment.
- **Model Development:** Lead research and implementation of next-generation transformer models, focusing on improving performance on tasks like summarization, code generation, and complex reasoning.
- **Performance Optimization:** Implement advanced optimization techniques such as quantization, knowledge distillation, and efficient attention mechanisms to reduce computational costs and improve API response times.
- **Mentorship:** Guide and mentor a team of senior AI/ML engineers, setting technical direction, conducting rigorous code reviews, and fostering a culture of innovation and excellence.
- **Cross-functional Collaboration:** Work closely with product leaders (like Isolde Beaumont on InsightIQ) and platform engineering managers (like Gideon Cross's team) to ensure the CoreLLM API meets the evolving needs of our products.

## Projects & Accomplishments
- **CoreLLM v3.0 Launch (Q1 2024):** Led the successful development and deployment of the third generation of our foundational model, which was a key enabler for the **Quantum Leap AI OEM partnership**. This new version achieved a 40% reduction in inference latency and a 15-point improvement on industry benchmarks.
- **Project "Helios" (2023):** Spearheaded the migration of the model training infrastructure from on-premise GPUs to a scalable Kubernetes cluster on Stratus Infrastructure, reducing average training time for experimental models by 60% and cutting infrastructure costs by 20%.
- **Fine-Tuning API Development (2022):** Designed and built the self-service fine-tuning API, allowing enterprise clients to securely adapt CoreLLM on their proprietary data. This feature was a critical factor in closing the hybrid deal with **Fusion Robotics**.

## Skills & Expertise
- **Programming Languages:** Python (Expert), C++, Go
- **ML/AI Frameworks:** PyTorch, TensorFlow, JAX, Hugging Face, LangChain
- **Cloud & DevOps:** AWS, Kubernetes, Docker, Terraform, Slurm
- **Specializations:** Large Language Models, Distributed Systems, MLOps, High-Performance Computing
