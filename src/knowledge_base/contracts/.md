## 1. Purpose
This directory serves as the definitive, single source of truth for all fully executed legal agreements involving Innovatech Solutions Inc. It is a critical component of our corporate governance and compliance framework. The markdown format is intended for internal knowledge management and RAG system ingestion; the original, signed PDF copies are stored securely in the Ironclad CLM platform.

## 2. Naming Convention and Identification
All files must adhere to the following naming convention: `[AgreementType] with [Counterparty Name] for [Purpose].md`. Each document's content must begin with a unique **Agreement ID** in the format `[TYPE]-[COUNTERPARTY_CODE]-[YYYY]-[NNN]`. This ID is the primary key for tracking the agreement across all company systems (Salesforce, NetSuite, Ironclad).

## 3. Access Control and Confidentiality
- **Access:** Read-only access is provisioned via role-based permissions to Legal, Finance, Executive Leadership, and designated personnel in Sales Operations and Customer Success.
- **Confidentiality:** The information contained within these documents is classified as **Innovatech Confidential - Level 3 (Highly Restricted)**.
